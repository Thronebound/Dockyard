# Dockyard
This is a continuation of the [DockyardMC](https://github.com/DockyardMC/Dockyard)
project maintained to sustain its continuous use in Thronebound, an 
up-and-coming MMORPG that will first be prototyped in Minecraft. The original
project has been archived following some controversy with its original creator,
and we don't want that to affect the progress we make on the initial 
implementation of Thronebound.

For reference purposes, here is the [old README](README_OLD.md).

## Documentation?
No. At least, not until I am comfortable maintaining this and have battle-tested
it some in official implementations.
